Solution from Alejandro Vila Traver

The lambdaman solution is based in just three items:
	*Labdaman previous direction
	*Ghost position
	*Number of bifurcations present in the alternative paths
The rest of the posible factors are not present because of a lack of time.
The lambdaman solution have been encoded with the help of wisual studio 2010, c# and wpf, the visual studio project is in the
present directory. I have used those to build just a bunch of helper function which let me create my assembler code. 
The code is simply generated as the Text property of a textBox that you can copy.

The ghost solution is based in a mixed but very simple strategy:
	*In a first stadium the ghost try to spread
	*In a second -and longer- stadium the ghosts try to get lambdaman
	*Repeat the sequence
As for lambdaman strategy everything else have been let out because of the lack of time.

¡¡Thank you for your amazing contest!!, it have been a very long time since the last time i ejoyed something so much.

Sorry if my english is not very good, i am trying to improve it.
